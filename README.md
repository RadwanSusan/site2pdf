# site2pdf

This tool generates a PDF file containing the main page and all sub-pages of a website that match a provided URL pattern.

**The PDF generated by this tool is particularly well-suited for AI RAG QA purposes.**

**Installation**

```bash
npm install
```

**Usage**

```bash
npm start -- <main_url> [url_pattern]
```

**Arguments**

* `<main_url>`: The main URL of the website to be converted to PDF.
* `[url_pattern]`: Optional regular expression to filter sub-links. Defaults to matching only links within the main URL domain.

**Example**

```bash
npm start -- https://www.example.com/ /https://www.example.com/sub/
```

This command will generate a PDF file named `www.example.com.pdf` containing all pages on the example.com domain.

**Implementation**

* Navigates to the main page using `puppeteer`.
* Finds all sub-links matching the provided `url_pattern`.
* Generates a PDF for each sub-link using `pdf-lib` and merges them into a single document.
* Saves the final PDF file with a slugified name based on the main URL.
    
**Note:** The provided `url_pattern` should be a valid regular expression. If no `url_pattern` is provided, the tool will default to matching only links within the main URL domain.

This tool is still under development and may have limitations. Feel free to contribute to the project by opening issues or pull requests!
